## Welcome!

Welcome to Laboratory for Cosmological Data Mining. We are excited that you have joined our group!

This document is to ease the transition into the research group so that you can blend in nicely and promptly.

This is still under-construction and please feel free to add anything.

It is usually password protected.

###Meetings:
Fall 2016:
We have weekly meetings. This semester we are having both graduate meeting and undergraduate meeting at the same time.

In the Spring semester of 2016, the general meeting time is from 9:30am to 11am on every Thursday unless noted otherwise.

Also if you need to leave early, say so that we can discuss your work before others.
If there has been changes to the meeting time, email will be sent to you at least by Thursday morning.


###Things you should keep in mind:
1. Check Will section below
1. If you won't like your project, please do not hesitate to ask professor Brunner for a different one.
1. Check the group manifesto


###Will:
1. Do not say anything about R, and stick to python.
1. Do not put any stickers on your laptop that may trigger Will (such as R studio sticker)
1. If you complain about how Espresso Royal charges 65cents for ice, he might like you
1. He claims that he doesn't know anything about computers.
1. He probably doesn't know why your codes run slow, so you should figure it out by yourself.
